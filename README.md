##### User Interface:

This extension only has one main dialog tab for manipulating the plot output.  The dialog, shown below, has the following options.

- Chart Components
 - X Axis – this selects a field from the input dataset that will be plotted along the x-axis
 - Y Axis - this selects a field from the input dataset that will be plotted along the y-axis
 - Category (Optional Grouping Variable) – If selected then the plot will be grouped by this variable, using color.  This variable is typically categorical and often is the class variable in a classification task
 - Chart Type – The current options for rCharts Basic Charts are Line, Scatter, and Bar.
- Chart Options
 - Use CDN – If this box is checked the HTML output from this extension will contain a link to a CDN (content delivery network) which hosts the necessary javascript libraries, otherwise this will be linked to a locally hosted version.
 - Height – Height in pixels of the plot
 - Width – Width in pixels of the plot
- Output
 - Temp/Custom Directory – This extension creates an HTML when creating output.  If you want to only view or take the source code from the document generated a Temporary file is best, but if you want to the HTML, select a directory to save.

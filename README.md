# Usage of Plotly charts in SPSS Modeler
##### Description:

This extention allows you to create good looking offline (no need pass data or library queries through internet) interactive D3.js charts, which are generated by Plotly R library. Generated graphs are fully interactive and can be shown in any web browser. The main advantage of these graphs is that you can plot additinal information, which can not be done with standard SPSS graphs nodes. In addition you can zoom charts and slide them.
